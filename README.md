# Problem Sets template

## Problem Set Logistics
Problem sets are due at 5PM Saturday. You have 4 late coins for the quarter. A late coin extends your deadline 24 hours. You may use up to one on a given problem set. When using them please acknowledge this in from matrer of your problem set. For each problem set, you will acknowledge that you are following the integrity policy. Please list all classmates who you consult/work with on a given problem set using the google form.

## Problem sets workflow

1. A pdf with the problem set will be on canvas, it has a link on it
2. Go to this link (assigment invitation) and accept it (refhresh your browser after accepting it and then click the link)
3. This will fork the starter repository into our organization's repository (datasci-harris), with your Github username
4. Click on code, select open with GitHub Desktop
4. This will open your GitHub Desktop and ask you if you want to clone the repository, select the folder you want it to live. By defauly Github Desktop will use the last folder you have used.
5. Rename `pset_template.Rmd` as directed by the homework
6. Work on your assigment using RStudio with this renamed file
7. Use `knitr` to create a `pdf` document for your assigment (now you have a pdf and a Rmd with the same name)
8. Go back to GitHub Desktop and commit and push your assigment to the cloud
9. You can check if your assigment was succesfully uploaded by going to github from your GitHub Desktop

Congratulations your pset should be now online! 

We will have a mini lesson on this and we will also post the recording. If you have any questions after watching the video please ask at lab.
